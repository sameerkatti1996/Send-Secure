# Send-Secure

This is a 6th semester project.

The application ensures dual layer security while exchanging messages. 
The message is encrypted and embedded into an image the user uploads.
The image is sent over to the receiver. 
Once the image is received, the embedded text is fetched and decrypted to get the original message.
